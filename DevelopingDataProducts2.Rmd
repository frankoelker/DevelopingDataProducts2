## Task

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. 

I will use the mtcars dataset.

## Slide with R code

```{r plotly, echo = TRUE}
myplot <- plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~hp, y = ~mpg, 
                  color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl), type = "scatter", 
                  mode = "markers")
myplot <- myplot %>% 
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "horsepower"),
         yaxis = list(title = "miles per gallon"),
         legend = list(title = list(text="Cylinders")),
         legend = list(x = 0.2, y = 0.9))
myplot <- myplot %>% 
    layout(legend = list(orientation = "h",
                       x = 0.4, y = -0.2))
```

## Slide with R Output

```{r plot}
